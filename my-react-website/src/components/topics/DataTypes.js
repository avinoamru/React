    <h3>Built-in Data Types</h3>
    <br />
    In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store data
    of different types, and different types can do different things.

    categories: Text Type: str Numeric Types: int, float, complex Sequence
    Types: list, tuple, range Mapping Type: dict Set Types: set, frozenset
    Boolean Type: bool Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
  </div>
