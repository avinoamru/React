    <h3>Creating Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming
      languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is
      created the moment you first assign a value to it. Example x = 5 y =
      "John" print(x) print(y)
    </p>
  </section>
);

export default Variables;
