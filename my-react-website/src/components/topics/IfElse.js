    <h3>Python Conditions and If statements</h3>

    <p>
      Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: Equals: a
      == b Not Equals: a != b Less than: a &lt; b Less than or equal to: a &lt;=
      b Greater than: a > b Greater than or equal to: a >= b These conditions
      can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
      An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword. Example If
      statement: a = 33 b = 200 if b > a: print("b is greater than a")
    </p>
