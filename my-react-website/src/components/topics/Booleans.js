    <h3>Boolean Values</h3>

    <p>
      In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
      You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers,
      True or False. When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated
      and Python returns the Boolean answer: Example print(10 &gt; 9) print(10
      == 9) print(10 &lt; 9)
    </p>
